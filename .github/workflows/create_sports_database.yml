    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5

      ## First, set up OpenEdge
      - uses: kenherring/openedge-actions/setup@v0.0.2
        with:
            license: ${{ secrets.PROGRESS_CFG }}
            download-ade-source: true
            version: 12.8.9

      ## Second, create the sports database using ant+pct
      - shell: bash
        working-directory: create_sports_database
        run: ant createDatabase

      ## Now, run a program that requires that database
      - uses: kenherring/openedge-actions/run@v0.0.2
        with:
          working-directory: create_sports_database
          parameter-file: sports.pf
          startup-procedure: get_first_customer.p

      ## Or, run tests which require that database
      - uses: kenherring/openedge-actions/ablunit@v0.0.2
        with:
          working-directory: create_sports_database
          parameter-file: sports.pf
          test-file-pattern: customer_test.p
