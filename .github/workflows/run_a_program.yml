    steps:
      - uses: actions/checkout@v5

      ## Example 1: Simply run a program
      ## * the `run` action will automatically call `setup` if no OpenEdge installation is detected
      - uses: kenherring/openedge-actions/run@e116f6ae11b3a85a02c0c7778b5ff08898ab3840
        with:
          startup-procedure: run_a_program/source_program.p

      ## Example 2: Set the propath to a subdirectory, and run a program relative to that subdirectory
      - uses: kenherring/openedge-actions/run@e116f6ae11b3a85a02c0c7778b5ff08898ab3840
        with:
          propath: 'run_a_program'
          # startup-procedure: source_program.p ## TODO
          startup-procedure: run_a_program/source_program.p ## this should theoretically fail
